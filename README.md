# Kickstarter_Application

Developed an application to support crowdsourcing for projects where users can convey their project ideas to viewers and get funding for their projects which they cannot afford on their own.
In return, the customers would get services based on the amount they have contributed.
Created different workspaces relative to different roles like admin, creator, donor and guest.
